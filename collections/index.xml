      <description>Premisses I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo to build this. It&amp;rsquo;s stored in a gitHub repo and with a submodule it links to another repo, where the site public content is generated into, to be served thanks to GitHub Pages.&#xA;So far all is done manually, and I need my own laptop to write, generate and push the changes.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t like this workflow.&#xA;Not only are too manual steps involved, is too clunky and Pages takes some time to update - and doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to update all at once, sometimes I get some inconstencies.</description>

      <description>These are the programming languages I would like to learn or improve my knowledge this year.&#xA;Kotlin Rust Python Kotlin is a more recent language that runs on the JVM and has been gaining traction over the years.&#xA;Rust is noteworthy for its innovative memory borrow model, which seems interesting to learn and work with. The language offers impressive performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s supported by Apple for iOS app development. It also incorporates functional constructs such as iterators and closures.</description>
