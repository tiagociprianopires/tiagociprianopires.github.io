      <description>Premisses I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo to build this. It&amp;rsquo;s stored in a gitHub repo and with a submodule it links to another repo, where the site public content is generated into, to be served thanks to GitHub Pages.&#xA;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo and not Jekyll is mostly because how much I hate installing Ruby in my macbook. That was the main reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Jekyll before and I liked it. The template language is so much easier than the one used in Hugo, but the simplicity of installing Hugo plus the auto-updated local server made me chose Hugo hands down.</description>

      <description>These are the programming languages I would like to learn or improve my knowledge this year.&#xA;Kotlin Rust Python Kotlin is a more recent language that runs on the JVM and has been gaining traction over the years.&#xA;Rust is noteworthy for its innovative memory borrow model, which seems interesting to learn and work with. The language offers impressive performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s supported by Apple for iOS app development. It also incorporates functional constructs such as iterators and closures.</description>
