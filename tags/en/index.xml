      <description>Premisses I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo to build this. It&amp;rsquo;s stored in a gitHub repo and with a submodule it links to another repo, where the site public content is generated into, to be served thanks to GitHub Pages.&#xA;The reason I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo and not Jekyll is mostly because how much I hate installing Ruby in my macbook. That was the main reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Jekyll before and I liked it. The template language is so much easier than the one used in Hugo, but the simplicity of installing Hugo plus the auto-updated local server made me chose Hugo hands down.</description>

      <description>Just edited the about page. We&amp;rsquo;re getting there. Still need to think about navigation. Maybe push these posts to the side and let the collections or pages be the center of the page. Not sure yet, but we&amp;rsquo;re getting there. I&amp;rsquo;m quite enjoying the creation of this.</description>

      <description>These are the programming languages I would like to learn or improve my knowledge this year.&#xA;Kotlin Rust Python Kotlin is a more recent language that runs on the JVM and has been gaining traction over the years.&#xA;Rust is noteworthy for its innovative memory borrow model, which seems interesting to learn and work with. The language offers impressive performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s supported by Apple for iOS app development. It also incorporates functional constructs such as iterators and closures.</description>

      <description>You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can&amp;rsquo;t control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Marcus Aurelius</description>

      <description>A friend works for a company that, after acquiring a software company for millions just for their know-how, allowed them to work in a silo while integrating their software into the main data stream. Subsequently, the company proceeded to fire them all. Now, they can&amp;rsquo;t understand or perform the required maintenance on what has become essential software. Having none of the knowledge that cost millions to acquire, the company has decided to fix this issue by hiring external consultants instead of relying on in-house developers.</description>
