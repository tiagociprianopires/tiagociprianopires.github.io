      <description>A friend works for a company that, after acquiring a software company for millions just for their know-how, allowed them to work in a silo while integrating their software into the main data stream. Subsequently, the company proceeded to fire them all. Now, they can&amp;rsquo;t understand or perform the required maintenance on what has become essential software.
